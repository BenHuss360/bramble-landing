# Bramble — Operations Playbook

*How a project flows from first contact to live map*

---

## Phase 0: Lead Generation & Outreach

### Finding leads
- Research estates, gardens, and hotels with significant grounds (10+ acres ideal)
- Check they don't already have a story map/app (like The Newt)
- Look for signs they invest in guest experience (events, tours, interpretation boards, printed guides)
- Properties that already do guided walks or seasonal trails are warm leads

### First contact
- Email to General Manager, Marketing Director, or Head of Visitor Experience
- Keep it short — introduce Bramble, reference their specific property, link to website
- Attach or link one case study (once you have one)
- Offer a no-obligation call or visit

### Discovery call (15-30 mins)
- Understand their current guest experience on the grounds
- What do they already provide? (printed maps, guides, signage, tours)
- What do guests miss? What feedback do they get?
- How large are the grounds? How many points of interest roughly?
- What's their appetite for investment in guest experience?
- **Goal:** qualify the lead and book a site visit if there's mutual interest

---

## Phase 1: Proposal

### After the discovery call, send:
- Tailored proposal (not generic — reference their property specifically)
- Scope: estimated number of story points, what's included
- Price (based on tier + any add-ons)
- Timeline (typically 6-8 weeks from site visit to launch)
- Case study / portfolio examples (when available)

### What to agree before the site visit:
- Number of story points (approximate — can adjust on the day)
- Whether audio narration is included
- Photography approach (see below)
- Who will be available on the day from their side
- Access requirements (keys, restricted areas, seasonal considerations)

---

## Phase 2: Site Visit — The Core Day

This is the most important day. Everything flows from what you capture here.

### Preparation (before you arrive)
- Research the property's history, ecology, notable features
- Download/print any existing maps or guides they have
- Check weather (you'll be outdoors all day)
- Charge all equipment
- Review any existing photography they've shared

### Equipment checklist
- [ ] Smartphone with GPS tracking app (record your walking route)
- [ ] Camera (or high-quality phone camera) — photos at each story point
- [ ] Audio recorder (phone or dedicated) — for all interviews and ambient sound
- [ ] Notebook + pen (backup, quick sketches)
- [ ] Portable battery pack
- [ ] Comfortable walking shoes
- [ ] Waterproof layer

### Who to meet on site

**Essential:**
- **Estate Manager / General Manager** — overview, access, logistics, what guests currently experience
- **Head Gardener / Grounds Manager** — plant stories, seasonal changes, hidden features, ecology

**Highly valuable (if available):**
- **Chef** (if kitchen garden) — which beds supply the restaurant, what's seasonal, the farm-to-plate story
- **Historian / Archivist** (if the property has one) — dates, events, notable figures, folklore
- **Long-serving staff member** — anecdotes, local lore, things that aren't in any book

**Nice to have:**
- **Owner / Family member** (if family-owned) — personal stories, vision for the estate
- **Events Manager** — what guests ask about, common interests

### The walk

**Record everything.** Audio-record the entire walk with your guide. You will not remember the details later — the name of the 400-year-old oak, which bishop planted the yew hedge, where the badger sett is. The recording is your raw material.

**At each potential story point:**
1. **Stop and GPS mark** the exact location
2. **Photograph** from the guest's perspective (what they'll see as they approach)
3. **Photograph** the feature itself (close-up, context, detail)
4. **Ask your guide to tell the story** in their own words (record this)
5. **Note seasonal variation** — does this look different in spring? Is there a better time of year?
6. **Note the approach** — which direction will guests typically arrive from?
7. **Note any sensory details** — sounds (water, birds), smells (herbs, blossom), textures

**What makes a good story point:**
- Has a story worth telling (history, ecology, folklore, personal anecdote)
- Is visually distinctive (guests can identify it when they arrive)
- Has enough space for a guest to stop and read/listen without blocking a path
- Is spaced well from other points (not too close together — let guests walk between stories)

**What to avoid:**
- Points that are too close together (overwhelming)
- Features with no story (just "this is a tree" isn't enough)
- Areas that are unsafe or inaccessible in certain weather
- Private/staff areas guests shouldn't wander into

### The interview

Beyond the walking tour, sit down for a dedicated interview (30-60 mins) with the most knowledgeable person. This is where you get the deeper stories.

**Interview structure:**

**Opening:**
- How long have you been at this estate?
- What's the first thing you'd show a friend visiting for the first time?
- What do most guests miss that you wish they'd see?

**History & heritage:**
- What's the oldest feature on the grounds?
- Are there any famous visitors, historical events, or local legends connected to the estate?
- How have the grounds changed over the years?
- Any ghost stories? (seriously — guests love these)

**Nature & ecology:**
- What wildlife lives here? Any rare or notable species?
- What are the seasonal highlights? (bluebells in spring, colour in autumn, etc.)
- Any champion trees, unusual plants, or botanical stories?
- How do you manage the grounds — any interesting conservation work?

**The human stories:**
- Any staff stories or traditions connected to specific places?
- What do guests most often comment on or photograph?
- Is there anything hidden that most people walk straight past?
- What's your favourite spot on the grounds and why?

**Practical:**
- Are there any areas that are off-limits or seasonal-access only?
- Are there existing QR codes, printed maps, or audio guides we should be aware of?
- Any upcoming changes to the grounds (new plantings, construction, restoration)?

**Record the entire interview.** Even the tangents — some of the best stories come from throwaway comments.

## Phase 3: Photography Decision

### Option A: Use existing estate photography
- **Pros:** Free, fast, estate has approved the images, often professionally shot
- **Cons:** May not cover specific story points, may be from wrong angle/season, generic "marketing" feel
- **Best for:** Estates with extensive photo libraries, budget-conscious clients, overview/hero images

### Option B: Commission new photography
- **Pros:** Captures exactly what's needed at each GPS point, from the guest's perspective, consistent quality
- **Cons:** Additional cost (£500-1,500 for a day), weather dependent, one season only
- **Best for:** Estates with limited existing photography, premium builds, story points in unusual locations

### Option C: Hybrid (recommended)
- Use existing photography for well-documented features (the house, main gardens, key landmarks)
- Shoot new photography for hidden gems, specific GPS perspectives, and atmospheric shots
- You can do this yourself on the site visit day with a good camera/phone
- Commission a professional photographer only if the client wants premium quality or you're doing a flagship build

### Seasonal photography plan
- First build uses whatever season you visit in
- Seasonal updates are an opportunity to refresh with new photos (spring blossom, autumn colour)
- Over 12 months, you'll build a full seasonal library for each story point
- This is a selling point for the annual subscription

---

## Phase 4: Content Creation (back at desk, 3-5 days)

### Process your recordings
1. Listen back to the full site walk recording
2. Transcribe key sections (or use AI transcription)
3. Pull out the best quotes, anecdotes, facts, and details
4. Cross-reference with your own research (dates, species names, historical accuracy)

### Write the stories
Each story point needs:
- **Headline** (8 words max — evocative, not generic)
- **Body text** (100-200 words — enough to be interesting, short enough to read standing outside)
- **Category tag** (History, Nature, Hidden Gem, Kitchen Garden, etc.)
- **Distance indicator** (how far from previous point)
- **Read time** or **Audio length**
- **Season notes** (if relevant — "best in May when the wisteria blooms")

**Writing style:**
- Second person ("As you stand here..." / "Look up and you'll see...")
- Present tense where possible
- Specific details over vague descriptions ("planted in 1743" not "very old")
- One story per point — don't cram everything in
- End with an invitation to look/notice something specific

### Audio narration (if included)
- **Option 1:** Professional voice-over — record in studio from written scripts
- **Option 2:** Estate staff voices — edit highlights from your interview recordings (authentic, unique)
- **Option 3:** AI-generated narration — fastest, cheapest, but less personal
- **Recommendation:** Use staff voices where the recording quality is good enough. It's more authentic and no one else can replicate it. Top up with professional voice-over for points where you don't have good audio.

### Photo editing
- Consistent colour grading across all images
- Crop to mobile-friendly aspect ratios
- Optimise file sizes for fast mobile loading
- Create a hero image for the map overview

---

## Phase 5: Map Build (2-3 days)

- Plot all GPS coordinates
- Set trigger radiuses (how close before the story appears)
- Design the map to match the estate's brand/colours
- Build story cards with text, images, audio
- QR code generation
- Test on multiple devices
- Test on-site if possible (or simulate GPS coordinates)

---

## Phase 6: Review & Launch

### Client review
- Share a preview link with the client
- Walk through each story point together (can be remote via screen share)
- Gather feedback — factual corrections, tone adjustments, photo swaps
- Expect 1-2 rounds of revisions

### Launch preparation
- Final QR code artwork (for print — reception cards, room folders, signage)
- Brief for reception/concierge staff ("here's what it is, here's how guests access it")
- Optional: guest WiFi portal integration (map link appears when guests connect)
- Optional: social media assets for the estate to announce the launch

### Go-live
- Activate the map
- Monitor usage analytics for the first 2 weeks
- Follow up with client at 2 weeks and 1 month
- Gather guest feedback (via the client)

---

## Phase 7: Ongoing Service

### Seasonal refreshes (2-4 per year)
- Update stories for seasonal relevance
- Swap photos if seasonal alternatives are available
- Add new story points if the estate has developed new features
- Remove or flag any temporarily inaccessible areas

### Analytics review (quarterly)
- Which story points get the most engagement?
- Where do guests spend the most time?
- Which points are rarely visited? (routing issue or uninteresting?)
- Average session length, completion rate
- Share insights with the client — this data is valuable to them

### Annual review (on-site or remote)
- Review overall performance
- Discuss new content opportunities
- Plan seasonal calendar for the coming year
- Renewal conversation

---
