# Bramble — Pricing Strategy & Go-To-Market Report

*Prepared: 28 January 2026*

## 1. What Bramble Is Really Selling

Bramble is not a map. It's not an app. It's a **guest experience layer** — a product that turns an estate's grounds into the story guests tell when they get home.

For the estate, this translates to:
- Higher guest satisfaction and TripAdvisor/Google ratings
- Longer stays and repeat bookings
- Marketing differentiation (something competitors don't have)
- Reduced reliance on printed materials and staff-led tours
- A modern, luxury-aligned digital touchpoint
- Shareable content — guests show friends, post online

---

## 2. The Value Equation

### For a luxury hotel:
A 50-room estate at £350/night and 70% occupancy generates ~£4.5M/year in room revenue alone. If Bramble increases average stay length by 0.1 nights or lifts occupancy by 1%, that's **£45,000+ in additional annual revenue**. Bramble's entire annual fee is a rounding error against that.

### For a visitor attraction (garden/historic house):
A garden charging £12-15 admission with 100,000 visitors/year = £1.2-1.5M revenue. Better visitor experience drives return visits, stronger reviews, and word of mouth. Even a 2% uplift = **£24,000-30,000/year**.

### What Bramble replaces or supplements:
| Current Spend | Typical Cost | Bramble Advantage |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Printed maps/guides | £2,000-5,000/year | Always outdated, disposable |
| Interpretation boards | £10,000-30,000 one-off | Fixed, can't update, weather damage |
| Guided tour staffing | £25,000-35,000/year per guide | Not scalable, limited hours |
| Custom app development | £50,000-100,000+ | Requires technical team to maintain |

Bramble delivers more than all of the above, for less than any single one.

## 3. Cost of Delivery

### Per-property time investment:

| Phase | Days | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Discovery & Walk | 1-2 | Travel to estate, walk grounds, identify story points, photography, GPS coordinates |
| Content Creation | 3-5 | Write stories, edit photos, record/edit audio, research history and ecology |
| Map Build | 2-3 | Build story map, GPS trigger setup, design, branding to match estate |
| Launch & Handover | 1 | QR code materials, staff briefing, WiFi portal integration if needed |
| **Total** | **8-11 days** | |

### Seasonal updates:
- 1-2 days per update
- 4 updates/year = 4-8 days/year

## 4. Pricing Framework

### Setup Fee (one-time)

| Tier | Estate Size | Story Points | Price |
|------|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Garden** | Under 10 acres | ~10 | £5,000-7,500 |
| **Estate** | 10-100 acres | ~25 | £7,500-12,000 |
| **Grand** | 100+ acres | 40+ | £12,000-18,000 |

Setup includes: discovery visit, full content creation (stories, photography), map build, GPS configuration, QR code materials, staff briefing, launch support.

### Annual Service

| Tier | Includes | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Standard** | Hosting, technical support, 2 seasonal refreshes | £3,000-4,500/year |
| **Premium** | Above + 4 seasonal refreshes, analytics dashboard, priority support | £4,500-6,000/year |
| **Full Service** | Unlimited updates, quarterly on-site visit, new content creation | £6,000-9,000/year |

### Add-Ons

| Service | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Professional audio narration | £1,500-3,000 |
| Multi-language support | £1,500-2,500 per language |
| Guest WiFi portal integration | £1,000-2,000 |
| Custom illustration/design | Quote based |

### Recommended Standard Price Point

**£7,500 setup + £4,500/year** (Estate tier, Premium service)

This positions Bramble as premium but accessible — less than a single interpretation board installation project, more than a throwaway digital product. It signals quality without requiring board-level approval.

---

## 5. Chain & Multi-Property Deals

For hotel groups (e.g. The Pig Hotels), offer a bundled rate:

| Item | Per Property | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Setup | £5,000 | ~30% discount from standard |
| Annual service | £3,500/year | Shared brand framework, centralised dashboard |

### Example: The Pig Hotels (9 properties)

| | Year 1 | Year 2+ |
|---|--------|---------|
| Setup (9 × £5,000) | £45,000 | — |
| Service (9 × £3,500) | £31,500 | £31,500 |
| **Total** | **£76,500** | **£31,500** |
| **5-year total** | | **£171,000** |

For context, building a custom app to do this across 9 properties would cost £50,000-100,000+ upfront, plus ongoing development costs. Bramble delivers more for less, with zero technical burden on the client.

## 6. First-Client Strategy

### The problem:
Bramble has zero clients, zero case studies, and zero social proof. The product concept is proven (The Newt built their own), but Bramble as a service is unproven.

### The solution: A pilot programme

**Option A — Free pilot (maximum door-opening power):**
> "We'll build your map at no cost. Use it for 6 months. If your guests love it, we move to an annual service agreement. All we ask is permission to use your name as a case study."

- Zero risk for the estate
- Gets a live product in the wild
- A recognisable name on the portfolio is worth more than any setup fee
- After the pilot, annual subscription is easy to justify with usage data

**Option B — Reduced pilot (signals value, covers costs):**
- £2,500 setup (covers direct costs)
- First year of service included free
- Case study and testimonial agreement
- Standard pricing from year 2

### Recommendation:
Use **Option A** for one marquee name (The Pig or Hestercombe — someone instantly recognisable). Use **Option B** for the next 1-2 clients. Then charge full price from client 4 onwards.

After 3 recognisable names in the portfolio, you never need to discount again. The case studies sell for you.

## 7. Why Not Go Cheaper

- A luxury estate spends more on flowers per month than a £3,000 setup fee
- Low pricing signals commodity, not craftsmanship
- These are businesses that pay £800 for a single wooden interpretation board
- If it costs less than a weekend's revenue from one room, they won't take it seriously
- Luxury brands buy confidence — the price must reflect the quality of what they're getting

## 8. Why Not Go Much Higher

- No client portfolio yet — you're asking them to bet on a new concept
- The category doesn't exist yet in most buyers' minds — no budget line for "story maps"
- Speed of market capture matters — better to land 20 clients at a fair price than 5 at a premium, because 20 clients = brand dominance in the niche
- You can always raise prices. You can't easily lower them.

## 9. Long-Term Revenue Model

### Year 1 target: 10-15 clients

| Revenue Stream | Conservative (10 clients) | Optimistic (15 clients) |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Setup fees | £75,000-100,000 | £112,500-150,000 |
| Annual service | £30,000-45,000 | £45,000-67,500 |
| **Year 1 total** | **£105,000-145,000** | **£157,500-217,500** |

### Year 2+: Recurring revenue compounds

| Year | Clients (cumulative) | New Setup Revenue | Recurring Revenue | Total |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | 10-15 | £75-150k | £30-67k | £105-217k |
| 2 | 20-30 | £75-150k | £90-135k | £165-285k |
| 3 | 35-50 | £112-200k | £157-225k | £270-425k |

The setup fee covers costs. The subscription builds the business. By year 3, recurring revenue alone could sustain the operation.

## 10. Competitive Moat

There is currently no direct competitor doing story maps for luxury estates as a managed service. But the concept is not technically hard to replicate. The moat is:

1. **Being first and being known** in this niche
2. **Content quality** — storytelling craft, not just pin-on-a-map
3. **Relationships** with estate owners and managers
4. **Portfolio** — 10 recognisable names makes Bramble the default choice
5. **Switching cost** — once stories are written and the map is live, changing provider means starting from scratch

Speed matters. Land clients fast, build the portfolio, own the category.
